# Pi-Case
Low profile case for a raspberry pi 4b

I have printed this case well on an out-of-box bambulabs X1-C, and decently on an Ender 3 with some finnicking. I will be updating the model over time so check-in for any updates.

I have updated the case to fit together by hooks printed into 2 of the sides. This did not require any supports for printing, just some minor clean up with an exacto knife.

I printed this in PLA and they fit togther just fine, I haven't tried PET-G or nylon, but I imagine the flexibility of those coupled with the higher thermal resistance would make for a great case.
