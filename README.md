# Pi-Case
Low profile case for a raspberry pi 4b

I have printed this case well on an out-of-box bambulabs X1-C, and decently on an Ender 3 with some finnicking. I will be updating the model over time so check-in for any updates.

Currently the halves fit together by friction fit, but the fit gets worse and the halves will start to come apart after a little bit. My next upgrade for this is to change how they fasten together.
